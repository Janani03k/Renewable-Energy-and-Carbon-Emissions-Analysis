# **Renewable Energy and Carbon Emissions Analysis**

## **Project Name**
**Renewable Energy and CO2 Emissions Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**

This project investigates the impact of renewable energy adoption on global carbon emissions. By analyzing data from the Global Carbon Atlas, we aim to understand the relationship between the increasing use of renewable energy sources and the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions worldwide. The study provides insights into emission trends over time, identifies major contributors to global CO2 emissions, and examines the effectiveness of renewable energy in mitigating climate change.

## **Project Goals**

1. **Analyze Global CO2 Emission Trends Over Time:**
   - Explore how global CO2 emissions have evolved and correlate these trends with significant global events or policy implementations.
  
2. **Identify Major CO2 Contributors:**
   - Pinpoint the primary countries responsible for CO2 emissions and observe any shifts in their rankings, indicating changes in energy regulations or industrial activities.

3. **Examine the Correlation Between Renewable Energy Adoption and CO2 Emissions:**
   - Assess the effectiveness of renewable energy in reducing carbon emissions across major economies.

4. **Analyze CO2 Emissions by Sector Across Different Regions:**
   - Identify key sectors contributing the most to CO2 emissions in various regions and explore targeted practices for reducing emissions.

## **Dataset**

- **Source:** [Global Carbon Atlas](https://globalcarbonatlas.org/)
- **Description:** The dataset provides extensive information on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production, categorized by country and year. This data is critical for analyzing global and national trends in carbon emissions and evaluating the impact of renewable energy adoption.

### **Key Columns:**
- **Country:** Facilitates country-specific analyses and comparisons.
- **Year:** Enables the examination of trends over time.
- **Total CO2 Emissions:** The primary indicator used to measure the impact of renewable energy on reducing carbon footprints.
- **Emissions by Sector:** Provides insights into sector-specific emission reductions and their correlation with renewable energy usage.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Data Processing & Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), Tableau
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib
- **Data Source:** Global Carbon Atlas
